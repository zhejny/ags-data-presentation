      <p className="poem-line">Borne by the channel of a green stream,</p>
      <p className="poem-line">
        Rounding ten thousand turns through the mountains
      </p>
      <p className="poem-line">On a journey of less than thirty miles...</p>
      <p className="poem-line">Rapids hum over heaped rocks;</p>
      <p className="poem-line">But where light grows dim in the thick pines,</p>
      <p className="poem-line">The surface of an inlet sways with nut-horns</p>
      <p className="poem-line">And weeds are lush along the banks.</p>
      <p className="poem-line">
        ...Down in my heart I have always been as pure
      </p>
      <p className="poem-line">As this limpid water is...</p>
      <p className="poem-line">Oh, to remain on a broad flat rock</p>
      <p className="poem-line">And to cast a fishing-line forever!</p>
